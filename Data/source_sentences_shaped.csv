"1.0","Bad","Beware! Check your credit card few days after staying make sure dont charge you something you may totally unaware time checkout did our stay. trying times where money tight I see great number people come together help others and  why I get so mad when I see business take advantage people during time so many helping. After you read ask yourself how many people do you think have done  type thing and how many havent noticed. people who thought got good price room just charged 40% more type practices.  Im writing all those people people 50 dollar charge means difference having food week something one children  needs rather paying something never bargained .  My wife and I stayed here Oct 3rd. We check out and get front desk 11:24 am and ones 10 minutes and finally get my bill everything order.  We drive home and my wife luckily checks our credit card and 50 dollar late check out fee. submitted 12:41 pm. More than an hour after checking out. (Stating an hour and half late checkout. Notice waited an hour after we left submit )  So we call Hilton corporation complain about charge. wasn't room damage wasn't because anything found an hour and half late checkout fee. I call Mellissa Ward ( manager) and she explained policy and I had said tbey put an hour after we left and I realized why practices exist after I feel I totally lied  You judge. Melissa tells me charge wasn't put 12:39 pm put 11:21 am. I shocked first because you charge 50 late fee leave place 20 minutes late? Yes, its our policy, she couldn't care, made more sense though her tell me explaining why put hour after we left. I thought an extreme charge must do regularly and get quite good profit off thos rip off practice.  I hung up dawned me. I checked out 1130 am, ( because one front desk)  put 11:21 am would have been bill. wasn't. course before I wrote I called Mellissa Ward back give her chance explain herself and time she wasn't availible left her message her voice mail explaining I wanted give her chance explain before I wrote anything. course she never called back. Why would she after being caught lie. So even gave me 500 dollars I wouldn't take down amend  Like I wrote earlier 50 dollars isn't issue I cant good conscience allow people do type things people maybe money makes difference. I hope thst you have choice you also support business take advantage people hard times  small amout money."
"3.0","Average","I went try place out and wish experience wonderful pretty.
Interior - 
place an Instagram-worthy cafe sure! design aesthetically pleasing. s cute place hang out. 
tea (pun intended) - 
drinks definitely more expensive end (about $5+). I ordered fruit teas and brown sugar boba. brown sugar one more expensive yet came significantly smaller cup. Furthermore, were only 2 customers before us yet we wait over 20 minutes our drinks. menu confusing too sizes varied depending specific drink rather than type (usually tea places offer size medium large all drinks same category least). instance drinks same category randomly were only available medium large both.

Overall, I don't see myself returning place. more expensive scale and doesn't offer anything other local tea places don't."

s something homey and comforting about food here. I've only ever got my food go, so I can't speak much about house dining what looks like inside because I've never picked up food myself. what I've heard, food always prepared quickly and ready time, which definite plus. 

First off, cheesesteaks HUGE. re basically 2-foot long log s 4-6 inches wide. MASSIVE. One cheesesteak could easily feed 3 people. meat finely chopped up, sliced (I know my Philly peeps have strong opinions . cheesesteak really good-- melty and oozing cheese, delicious soft bread, and perfect some added jalapeño peppers. Highly recommend! 

We also ordered pizza sausage and mushrooms which just okay. Nothing really stood out about  satisfying. little oily my liking, necessarily bad thing LOL.

"4.0","Good","Tamarindos semi-hidden[1] treasure, yet another surprisingly tasty Mexican place suburbs. BYOB's unremarkable exterior does little attract customers its strip mall. fact, does so little we thought deserted until we pushed past curtains fending off winter draft!

Unlike outside, interior delicious, beautiful oil paintings lining walls. lively crowd, and nearly all tables were taken. chatter conversation and Mexican music married well, and dim lighting[2] makes Tamarindos quaint date spot.

Interestingly, few menu items had stars next description. We couldn't figure out meaning - maybe s key menu now? I think I heard stars expressed dish's heat level, I'm unsure. Dishes pricey Mexican (think fancy Mexican!) chef (chefs) makes worth splurge.

My entree, ""Camarones la Diabla"" ($21.60) consisted jumbo shrimp cooked Tamarindos's version diabla sauce, along guajillo, jalapeno, and poblano peppers, onions, and pineapple, rice. shrimp and allied vegetables weren't spicy I'd like, enough spice casual diner, an explosion flavors!

Throughout night, our server (Stephanie) point, bringing us free tasty chips, fresh salsa, our entrees, all time. Another server provided complimentary margaritas (""Mexican water,"" she smiled) which helped pass time nicely.

When second leg my international flight canceled, I booked myself room Marriott Downtown and ordered dinner Tower Style Pizza.  I exhausted and needed some quick food.  Fast forward two and half hours.  My food arrives after 4 phone calls where I hung up and told were too busy check whether my order had gone out.  I already asleep and had wake up get food.

"5.0","Good","We attended Holiday Lights Festival Florida Botanical Gardens and joy! 

We went Saturday night which busiest night and slight negative; crowd so large made harder experience everything still gets 5 stars! signs up suggesting you can visit Sunday through Thursday avoid crowds, I would agree and next year, we try attend during week, Don't let crowds scare you off though you can handle crowd because fun experience. 

s free get do suggest $5 per adult donation. gardens free year round and money raise donations especially event helps keep free everyone. 

Parking free well and we found place easily and didn't have walk very far enter. Please note, walking event. You do decent amount walking. strenuous and plenty places stop and relax although seating limited everywhere large crowd nights holiday light events. Keep mind matters you any reason. 

park always dog friendly even during lights festival. We brought our dog. little daunting large crowd she had good time. 

Now describe gardens and lights festival. I think truly enjoy garden, you should go during day lights so awesome annual event! many, many displays and garden certainly keeps nature/animal friendly theme. I'm sure which section my favorite might wedding garden. so lovely! also main courtyard where you'll find refreshments and nightly entertainment! 
I'm including photos your viewing please photos don't really convey entire experience, so go and take  

Don't miss info center and gift store. I really enjoyed and even bought few items. I learned nice ladies running store s non-profit and all money earned store goes back gardens. How nice! 

My one criticism and suggestion garden would any way possible make info center and gift shop area dog friendly would great. My boyfriend had wait outside and watch our dog while I went center and shop. He would have enjoyed coming well. I understand concerns shop since s small area many smaller, breakable trinkets. I can't imagine any thousands strollers night moving around either seems area outside and info center could dog friendly. I do want again acknowledge how nice have all gardens dog friendly! 

Don't hesitate enjoy amazing place. We so lucky have cool, beautiful garden like our community. Thank you all volunteers who help keep garden going!"

Okay, I am very busy and son wanted his Xbox back I figured about $100 little more. Well he called me wanting replace whole motherboard and part alone cost $250. I asked you being serious? whole used system cost $250! His comeback: ""scalping more"". Bottom line plug and play shop an actual repair shop. long only need work some screws and unplug few cables sure. real troubleshooting taking place. I asked his partner what troubleshooting methods were used determine whole motherboard needed replaced and specifically what were various readings he took his multimeter.

"1.0","Bad","far worst Hilton property I've stayed  apparently, most staff hotel agree. you considering booking, please look recent reviews (all great reviews years ago. still actually use reviews when were Hyatt). 

During our stay, my kids were introduced whole new line profanity child should hear. Add fact our entire floor smelled pot numerous nights and smoke pot outside lobby openly (still illegal PA). Can't say I'm shocked when owner about show up, some lady pink ran outside and cleared crowd. I'm shocked didn't want owner see how disgusting his hotel had become. 

hotel staff blame worker shortage and new staff all mistakes, yet have problem being pull occupancy even though rooms up par (our room needed maintenance almost daily because AC didn't work first four nights, we were able keep room semi cool fan and having keep our blinds closed entire time). Housekeeping cannot even turn rooms time (even though selectively pick up trash won't touch glasses all). end night we would put out glasses would just sit outside until someone complained front desk (usually took about 1.5 days). 

Housekeeping blames management, apparently one service elevators has been broken over two years and cannot get rooms time because elevator wait times  (lines elevators were ridiculous). I guess s reason towels were provided all guests our room.  When we ordered extra towels, came long black hair. My wife blonde and my mother law gray, one has long black hair. 

bright spot, you stay here. morning staff, Stevie and Mike pleasant and helpful. George, and Carl two managers who actually seem care and very pleasant. afternoon staff  Lead Rebecca, who has some difficulty communicating facts passing messages management. Any interaction her I would confirm morning staff management. She blatantly lied numerous occasions. rest afternoon staff nice can't really help. 

Hopefully things improve and hotel gets back Hilton standards, even remodel least cleaning.

Crispy Brussels Sprouts - Loved addition honey.
Black Mussels - Delicious broth/ good-quality seafood.

So I excited go Thursday celebrate our 32 anniversary.  WOW.  What let down.  one person waiting tables, and were 6 tables, including ours, being used.  waitress took our order our garlic bread appetizer.   later, another couple came and ordered meal came salads.  waitress gave them our garlic bread, realized her mistake after were eating salads.  She explained, she would charge them, should know further visits, garlic bread wasn't free.  She came and explained what she did, and she said she put another garlic bread us.  She took our dinner orders.  My husband ordered shrimp scampi, and said ""ok"".  I ordered chicken parm pink sauce. (What I had been dying have again). My husband and I both agree.......chicken parm pink sauce MUCH better, few years ago.  So disappointing.  I'm sure what changed, reminded me Olive Garden chicken parm.  waitress came over and said table accidentally got our garlic bread paying our bread.  WHY!?!  He didn't make mistake.........why isn't Little Italy giving us bread?  Having wait SOOOOOOO long go back, my expectations were too high, I guess.  Like I said.........just like an Olive Garden.  I also suggest have more than one person working dining area.  floors were messy and tables waited forever cleared.  Good thing Thursday night, and were busy.


UPDATE: I contacted owner, and she personally offered cook me, I let her know when we returning.  very nice gesture!  We try Little Italy again, some day.  Thanks, Jessica!"

"3.0","Average","vet services so far seem decent, and care about our 2 dogs. boarding services atrocious. We won't boarding our dogs here again. We have an 8-month old Labrador, and we still working training him. didn't let him out often enough, so he constantly peed crate (big set back our training). He gets anxious  probably reason, so re immediate response always drug dogs. (We've used drug before him only occasionally, 4 days straight/couple times day.) said bath complimentary stay said he too wild bath - which he has lot energy (1) he drugged and (2) we just use PB mat home and he completely distracted, and doesn't even care he's bath. Seems like could have figured out? Weird how boarding services so poor, seems like give dogs minimal attention. 

Also, NEVER answer phone. Sometimes I have concern about my pup and find eventually call you back you leave voicemail - you can text them and slightly more responsive. seems little unprofessional NEVER answer phone. (Literally, I would call 10 times day and only get response when I remembered leave message text them...)"
"4.0","Good","So, Olive Garden and I go way back. When I college 1980's, I used drive up Indy Friday nights Olive Garden close Lafayette Square Mall. Times have changed. So, I didn't know what expect Olive Garden modern, COVID-19 age. restaurant chain gets lot bad press and lot negativity social media. However, my experience Olive Garden actually very positive.

First off: food quality pretty decent. Yes, s true I've spent last seven years leaving Yelp reviews 5-star ""fine dining"" restaurants, so my standards have come up little since I college student 80's. breadsticks, salad and lasagna were all perfectly delightful, and never any shortage food table.

Secondly, our server an awesome young lady who extremely attentive and pleasant. And, overall cleanliness restaurant great.

"2.0","Bad","second time I've been here. first time I had flautas pork and were fine although you have ask everything side dump bunch things top which makes flautas soggy. So, time I ordered chicken flautas and ordered everything side - started out quite crispy. However, some reason, instead just using chicken which I've had other places, use chicken some sort sweet tomatoe-y sauce which made flautas both sweet and soggy. Very unwelcome.

Also, beans had flavor, were watery and guacamole little off-color. I've actually traveled through Mexico, and do find food restaurant authentic."

My boyfriend bought 2 living social deals $12 each, which ended up covering 4 1-hour passes. We went 2 our other friends Saturday mid-afternoon. None us had ever been place like  so we weren't really sure what expect, we had heard several kids my friend works best jump place around Tampa Bay area.

4 us who went all 20-something-year-olds and we all had blast!!! Who knew jumping could workout?! Luckily when we went, very crowded kids all, so we didn't have worry much about demolishing all little kids. Though towards end, big birthday group kids had arrived and open jump area got pretty overwhelming. mostly kids under 10 years old, few teenagers, and maybe one other couple around same age us who also had living social deal use. Lots parents around none them participated jumping. 

set-up much cooler than I expected because I thought d just one massive room big trampoline. s several different areas -- one 4v4 dodgeball, one area younger kids 1v1 ""airball""  (trampoline version basketball) and another area bigger kids 2v2 airball. Unfortunately, one airball slots broken so we could only do 1v1 airball and 2v2 still lot fun! Dodgeball pretty fun too -- 4 us 20-something-year-olds got crushed several times little kids... who knew playing dodgeball little kids could so hard?! You wouldn't think have so much less surface area hit! 

main area pretty big and you can even jump off walls!! s even little stretch has big padded cushion very end so you can attempt flips and stuff onto  I had so much fun trying do front flips and back flips onto big mat! 

We didn't eat here so I can't comment quality food passed little food stand and prices were extremely reasonable. 

An hour definitely more than plenty time spend here (least us, kids might have energy stay longer!).We left end drenched sweat totally worth  Would definitely come back."
"3.0","Average","Kinda cute inside, s sealed off due covid. put some wooden picnic tables outside and have good pick up/ordering system going, and s cute place corner gather. Dog friendly. and sometimes selection sweet breads/pound cakes.

Unfortunately, coffee has always been little weak and sometimes I'd add an extra shot flavor only.  combined alternative milks (and theirs comes... sweetened??) I'm paying like $8 medium iced beverage still tastes off.

My very last $8 drink, I ended up throwing out and buying new cup elsewhere. barely coffee milk. tasted like when I lazily refill my coffee cup water without rinsing out last sip two.

couple times, one and I greeted little written brb note still when I walked after going another cafe. Some days don't have bagels and/croissants sandwiches recently returned menu. Those do take long time come out, taste pretty good.

Unfortunately, all my guests were left unimpressed food and customer service, which left me feeling need apologize even recommending place. I made decision based off beautiful interior decor and interesting menu items. s all food  interesting. We ordered so much food, and only plate I enjoyed berry shortcake. Two my guests didn't even finish plates and one had swap out another meal. I don't mind paying high prices food, long I'm eating quality food. I've never been so frustrated because each time new plate came out , just let down once more . Also, fact assign two servers table quite weird, especially since only 7 people and I've never had experience elsewhere. worked together I could understand, were so disconnected each other, and customer service only robotic ungenuine well. I would come back and would pick another ""upscale"" restaurant over one.

Appetizers : fried peppers - just alright , something you can make home . Unimpressive presentation well.
Fried calamari - lacked flavor and texture wasn't well.
Goat cheese baklava- appetizer had balancing flavors, all I could taste an overwhelming amount goat cheese and thin fillo dough.

Entree : lobster rolls cauliflower mash -  meal portion so small I left confused. lobster rolls were basic and fishy. Also, cauliflower mash served cold ( must've made soon).

Dessert : chocolate molten cake hard rock and Applebee's has better molten cake, need say anything else .

restaurant decor and ambiance great especially live music , making perfect couples (don't recommend group dining ) . However , food and customer service component missing . s pretty clear , I don't plan coming back."

"5.0","Good","OMG. 

basically only way describe my experience Oystercatchers brunch. since my review would way too short I stopped  I'll elaborate little bit. 

After doing some poking around local blogs and asking my fellow Yelpers, I concluded I just had get myself over Oystercatchers some point brunch. I think I had place my ""do"" list past few months since I heard brunch buffet out control good. 

So, I went. I saw place, I ate (obviously). And hype right. 

We were seated right window overlooking bay. probably one nicest views I've ever had restaurant. I so happy we snagged table window! 

We got started buffet and huge variety tasty and innovative food us try. cheese and charcuterie area (my personal favorite), pasta station, an omelet station, various salads, various breakfast meats and other breakfast items like waffles and French toast. 

I basically stopped every area since s why I  I don't think I had one single item tasted bad. 

service great throughout. Our waiter brought us new silverware and cleared our plates very quickly after we would finish them and go back more. also bottomless champagne and mimosas! I didn't partake bottomless soda too so cool well. 

Oystercatchers has an entire room dedicated desserts, which how I ended my visit. I had quite time  eating chocolate mousse, flourless chocolate cake, creme brûlée, cute little fruit tarts. All were delicious and too sweet too flavorless -- were just right. 

I came here part belated birthday celebration so restaurant nice enough bring me out sweet birthday treat! wonderful. 

I had fantastic time Oystercatchers. While expensive, I believe you should try least once. views great, service wonderful and food hits spot."

"1.0","Bad","I manage local gas station. Last year, Lithia Hyundai employee came and, since we often have problems Chase cards Lithia employees use outside pumps, we allowed him fill up first & pay when he done. card declined $37, & Lithia Hyundai refused pay charge. pretended ""questioned"" & none them were responsible.  Tonight, happened again, $100 time. Employee said he would wait outside his boss, Jeffrey, come & pay, & drove off. 

s pretty sad small local station extends Lithia courtesy few fill-ups, & Lithia dodges paying paltry $137. Definitely doesn't reflect well them Reno business community. Worth noting when happens, s EMPLOYEES who have pay charge. So Lithia only stiffing local business, also allowing few minimum wage workers pay DEALERSHIP'S bills. Pretty pathetic."

"3.0","Average","Okay, so I found place ~TikTok~ and poster talking about ""vibes great, vegan charcuterie board"" etc etc. I would agree, s nice vibe. Lots seating, very open. Inside and outside options. great place congregate group! Here my critiques: 
- Service: I walk  literally one greet me. I have look around find someone who works here. After about minute I do, and I am asking I order bar table. response: ""yeah""... Yeah what? Which one do I do? staff very direct, which I didn't really like. Like, just tell me what do. I manage sit down and when I am seated, again, staff just... kind awkward, which made me feel awkward. sure fair thing review, since staff interchangeable, just my experience.
- Prices: I get having alcohol out always expensive, pour size... yeah,  giving.
- Food: Now, TikTok I saw made food look so good! plate I brought out... giving Kroger veggie and fruit tray. I got vegan charcuterie board and really tasted store bought. Didn't look fresh. carrots looked old and tired. supremely underwhelming. Also, menus were drawn up Microsoft word 30 minutes and printed off errors. just did look like professional business' menu should. 

So, I would probably come back big group and only get drinks!"

I ordered long ride shield my GL1500 and I installed bike.  During day shield just OK, night too dark,  shortest windshield too tall and must looked through which problem clear shield LRS only offer ""Light Tint"".  light tint one thing shields dark and only suitable riding during day.

company should re-evaulate term ""Light Tint"".  tint causes safety issue you do any riding night.

I called, spoke ""Brandon"", explained ""light tint"" too dark see through and safe night riding. He understood and said he had similar complaints. I asked I could return he said problem.  I explained him I installed shield and removed plastic film.  He again said problem.  He said fill out return authorization website, I did and return denied, plastic film removed. which earlier Okay ""Brandon"".  I replied back unknown person hiding behind email approved ""Brandon"".  response, just crickets.

"2.0","Bad","First I want start saying facility very nice. apartments and community areas very attractive. have pretty good food restaurant type setting and many activities available.  Parking can difficult many guest spots and spots assigned residents extremely narrow making difficult person who needs use walker other assistance device get vehicle. 
I would also like say most staff great. Most staff treat residents respect and do talk down condescend them. Unfortunately like any where else always exceptions. 
reason I am giving five star, 2 star rating twice, both times evening, I have requested help front desk my friend and were either extremely slow unable offer basic assistance.
first time my friend feeling faint so I went down front desk ask someone could come up and take her blood pressure. I told she independent living were sorry service could perform. I shocked senior facility where residents definition seniors didn't have anyone staff who qualified take simple blood pressure reading. nearly $5000 month you would think would have someone staff capable task. 
second bad experience also happened evening. My home extremely close five star so when my friend called me say she had fallen and could I come over since she having problem getting up, (she didn't feel like she seriously injured nearly 90 you can't careful)  I less than 5 min. When I got her door I realized locked so I quickly used hall phone call front desk and tell them my friend had fallen and I needed someone come up immediately key she floor. I waited over 5 minutes someone bring keys and my husband went down front desk find out what taking so long. When he got down receptionist still desk. Apparently other person break and she waiting someone come take over desk before she came up. I couldn't believe  nearly 90 year old person locked apartment who knew what condition laying floor and she waiting someone come take over front desk before she brought key. Again nearly $5000 month you would think would have someone available respond timely manner what could have been life threatening emergency. 
When she finally got room first thing she did tell my husband he couldn't come  I think she would have attempted ban me apartment also wasn't happening. We entered found my friend floor seriously injured. She immediately started berating my friend having taken off her call button take shower and having all times. She correct my friend should have been wearing her call button my opinion an elderly person floor appropriate time lecture. I called 911 and paramedics arrived apartment quicker than she had arrived front desk. After paramedics left she continued going about emergency alert button. and I also found amazing she told us my friend had pushed her emergency button she would have only waited 5 minutes relief person and someone couldn't get amount time she would have after 5 minutes locked front door and came up see what wrong. Does anyone else think waiting 5 minutes when someone has pushed an emergency alert button makes sense. person feels enough peril need push an emergency alert button situation should treated an emergency. Enough said. I say I find policies concerning and I talking my friends family about situation. Bean bag games and shuttle drivers all well and good policy isn't respond timely manner possibly life threatening situations have person staff capable taking blood pressure reading my opinion really nothing more than an over priced apartment."
"3.0","Average","Let me start just going through specifics I give my opinion. Aesthetically beautiful. Everything about well designed poorly executed. My wife and I arrived about 7pm Saturday night. We were told would 20 minute wait and given buzzer. We were directed wait outside. warm evening I asked we could wait bar. hostess smiled and said course. So we walked around bar,... twice,... and third time. When we did finally locate 2 empty seats and attempted sit down we were instructed those seats were being held friends had arrived yet. So, we went outside. We couldn't find place sit outside. We tried walk down marina find locked gates and lots smokers. I also noticed my buzzer out range. So we went back and trolled bar. Stood and waited someone leave. Finally did get place sit and our buzzer went off. So, went back up hostess get our table. We were seated nice table took 15 minutes before waitress noticed we were  She came and gave us menus, took our drink order and left put those  We looked over menus... Very limited menu. 1 page. list about dozen appetizers. list maybe six very expensive salads. list 8 entrees none which were under 27 dollars. And large list very overpriced burgers and sandwiches. time our waitress came back our drinks. She informed us specials. None which sounded very special. She asked us we were ready order we needed more time. Since I knew my wife struggling finding something I told waitress we needed more time. Big mistake... we didn't see her again 20 minutes. time we saw her again we needed more drink again were also able get our order  I ordered seared scallops. My wife ordered hamburger sliders off appetizer menu. my relief our order came faster than I expecting. Upon reflection I guess I should have seen red flag. My seared scallops... 2 them were perfect, 2 were burnt, 2 were undercooked and 2 were raw. My wife's meal, hamburger sliders... only hamburger meat cooked smelled sour. When our waitress came back ask how our meals were I explained her our issues. She did seem upset about food preparation did insist having manager come speak us. He came about ten minutes. He said he heard we had problem our meal. I went through everything him. He apologized and said he would take care meal. When waitress returned she brought us our check stating manager had indicated her he comping my wife's meal had put bill and give us an equivalent amount off coupon. Which fine. technical sense means we still had pay taxes I did want split hairs. Total bill came 37 dollars dinner 2 although I did have stop way home and get something else my wife eat. 
Now... place beautiful. Nice romantic atmosphere well planned and all ingredients needed wonderful evening. I would liked have seen better menu ( more variety and less emphasis pub food like hamburgers ) and very overpriced. I don't mind paying more meal its worth  Ours definitely fell short. staff adequate. Well trained and freindly seemed almost over staffed and complacent. I honestly think proper management could have done better job fewer people. Yes, were several people wearing staff t-shirt indicating worked literally just stood one place whole time we were and didn't move. were less than 5 hostesses hovering front door tell you could seat you yet. Finally while good sized bar, had 4 bartenders staffing  I have bartended myself before similar sized bar. most we ever used 2 bartenders and 1 barback. 
Anyway... overall I give nice try  
swing and miss. Poor management. 
I probably go back assess things getting better sake potential improve."

She went far pointing us out her coworkers, still didn't greet us, picked up her phone and started texting. We proceeded sit another couple minutes without being acknowledged. Someone finally came up say hi, asked us how we were doing tonight and I told her 'well we've been sitting here 20 minutes without any service.' She told me 'I'm sorry I'm only one serving tonight.'
